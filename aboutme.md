# About Me
As a dedicated and results-driven professional with masters in Business Analytics and Business Administration, I have honed my expertise in business development, analysis, and project management. With a passion for creating strategic value, I thrive in environments where innovative thinking meets data-driven decision-making. My career journey has been marked by a commitment to excellence, consistently delivering high-impact solutions that align with organisational goals.

My skills in strategic planning, technical transformation and change management have been the cornerstones of exceeding business targets, while my expertise in data analytics played a pivotal role in enhancing portfolio management and client retention.

Bridging the gap between business operations and technology has not only improved customer satisfaction but also contributed to the organisations success in business development. My tenure at different organisations reflects a commitment to fostering growth and leveraging analytical skills to navigate complex business environments.
